Update came in a little late - sorry!

## Games
### **Completed:**  
- *Nier Replicant* – Beautiful game, started Drakengard 3 immediately after to fill the void.
- *Stardew Valley* – Finally reached perfection so I can say I "beat" the game basically. Probably won't play for another year or so.

### **Playing:**  
- *Drakengard 3* – Technically I finished this but this is my May notes (┬┬﹏┬┬) Spent all of May beating this game.
- *Infinity Nikki* - Always.

## Reading
- *QQ Sweeper* – Prequel to Queens Quality, which I'm starting next.


## Watching
- *Nathan For You* – Re-watch. I'm prepping my husband for The Rehersal.
- *Fafner* – Baby's first mecha (kind of).

## Life Updates
- Busy building my cosplay for upcoming cons I'm going to in July and August.
- I saw *Pierce the Veil* live!

## Site Updates
- [x] Light theme added but idk if I'll keep it

## Goals for Next Month
- Idk it's literally June.
- Get these notes out sooner.
