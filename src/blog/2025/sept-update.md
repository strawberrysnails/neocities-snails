Autumn is my favorite season
## Games 

### **Playing:**  
- *NieR: Automata* – Completed 24/26 of the endings!
- *Chess* – I play this when I'm anxious as a distraction so my rating dropped a lot.(＞︿＜)
- *Sweet Fuse* – Hmm, which route to pick? 

### **Watching:**
- *Ys I & II* – I just finished watching my husband play and the story was so fun.
- *Ys: Origin* – I don't know much about the story yet but the gameplay looks super interesting.

## Books
### **Reading:** 
- *The Irresistible Urge to Fall For Your Enemy* by Brigitte Knightley – Based off of my favorite Dramione fanfics.
- *Katabasis* by R.F. Kuang – Very very curious where this will go.

## Site Updates
- [x] New [RSS Feed](/updates/feed.xml) just for site updates.
- [x] Kicking off the [Shrines](/shrines) page with [Drakengard 3](/shrines/drakengard3)

## Goals for Next Month
- I have a template idea I'd like to make.
- Actually complete [Weird Web October](/notebook/weirdweb2025).
