My husband and I took a little day trip to NYC, here's what we did.

## Museum of Natural History

First stop: **American Museum of Natural History**. It was my first time here, I really enjoyed the fossils, mammal dioramas, and the ocean life exhibits.

One of my favorite things I learned about was the Rafflesia, which I saw a sculpture of in the Hall of Biodiversity. It stood out to me because in **Animal Crossing**, if you get the "worst" rating for your towns environment, a large red flower spawns on the ground and it looked eerily similar to that one, so I had to find out its name. Rafflesia, aka "Stinking Corpse Lily".

I picked up something small at the gift shop too, of course.

We spent hours at the museum but I would love to go back and explore more. Next time, I want to check out the mineral exhibits.

## Obligatory Sweet Treat

After the museum, we had to get a sweet treat at **Salt and Straw**.

Strawberry Tres Leches and Salted, Malted, Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, respectively.

## Central Park Walk

After our sweet treat, we took a walk through **Central Park**. It was nice and quiet, a much needed break from the busy city streets. I saw so many turtles and a very nice view of the skyline.

## Shopping Haul

After the trek through central park from the upper west side, we got to do some shopping in mid-manhattan.
Places we stopped at: **UNIQLO, Book off, Kinokunyia.**

I don't have a **UNIQLO** local to me, unfortunately, so I wanted to take advantage of the NYC location. It was _huge_, so much larger than expected. My husband and I both picked up a few things. I stepped out of my comfort zone a bit and bought a dark green dress instead of black! （・o・；）

**Book off** was definitely a favorite for me. We rifled through their used CDs and figures for a long time. I was on the hunt for [this specific CD](https://project-imas.wiki/THE_IDOLM@STER_MILLION_THE@TER_WAVE_02_Chrono-Lexica) (After realizing their stock of IDOLM@STER is excessive) but got a bit unlucky. I still found some cool CDs for $5 each.

At **Kinokuniya** I picked up a Hatsune Miku noodle stopper. She lives on my PC next to my others.

CDs: [THE IDOLM@STER MILLION THE@TER WAVE 06 Hanasakuya](https://project-imas.wiki/THE_IDOLM@STER_MILLION_THE@TER_WAVE_06_Hanasakuya), [THE IDOLM@STER MILLION THE@TER WAVE 15 chicAAmor](https://project-imas.wiki/THE_IDOLM@STER_MILLION_THE@TER_WAVE_15_chicAAmor), and [THE IDOLM@STER MILLION THE@TER GENERATION 12 D/Zeal](https://project-imas.wiki/THE_IDOLM@STER_MILLION_THE@TER_GENERATION_12_D/Zeal)

Yeah, I like IDOLM@STER music a lot and it was like 90% of their CD selection.

## The End

Well, I have a love/hate relationship with NYC but I wanted to make the most of it since it was my husbands first time there. I've visited many, _many_ times. We both agree that it's a bit overstimulating and smelly. Dispite that, we had a great time! Now we don't have to visit for another few years hehe :3

Thanks for reading!
