Excuse the lack of regular updates, life, as it always does, has gotten in the way. Snails is still here forever and I look forward to having more time to regularly update again. For now, I'll just be uploading blog posts.

## Games 

### **Playing:**  
- *Chess* – My elo is on the rise!
- *NYT Games* – Crosswords, sodoku, worldle, ect. 

### **Completed:** 
- *NieR: Automata* – 26/26 Endings done. What's next?

## Books
### **Reading:** 
- *Alchemised* – Another dramione inspired book. I've read the fanfiction it is based off (of course).

### **Completed:** 
- *The Irresistible Urge to Fall For Your Enemy* – Genuinely so entertaining and fun to read.
