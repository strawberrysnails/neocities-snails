## Life Updates
It's been a bit since I've updated the blog and website in general. I took some time to be offline a little bit especially since closing on a house and moving into it!
Then on top of that, I was very busy with typical holiday obigations. I'm hoping now I'll be able to update the site regularly again.

## A Quick November & December recap

### Playing
- *Blue Prince* - Still slowly working through this, when I have the time to game.
- *Divinity Original Sin* - Husband and I are in Act 2.
- *Greg Tech New Horizons* - Wrote [a whole blog post](/blog/2025/minecraft-forever-world-1027/) on this. We are almost starting the steam age. 

### Reading
- *Alchemised* - This had mixed reviews online but I genuinely loved it.
- *Dead Until Dark* - I deserve a little vampire romance after the tragedy that was Alchemised.
- *Absolute Boyfriend* - Fun Shoujo manga to pass the time. 

### Watching
- *Doctor Who* - As always.
- *Gilmore Girls* - A cozy winter classic
- *The Rehersal* - Starting season 2.
-  *Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions!* - Very fun and wholesome.
