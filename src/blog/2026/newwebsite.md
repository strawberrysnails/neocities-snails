## Hello
Well, I've created a new website off-platform! I really want **snails.town** to be a personal scrapbook, a digital diary, and a home-y place to be. It's time for tutorials and "learning in public" blog posts to move out of the town and into a new space. A blog I'm calling [strawberrysnails](https://strawberrysnails.github.io/).

## Why?
I really enjoy writing about coding and making tutorials but it doesn't seem right for my humble town. I also think it would be a good idea to have a bit of a professional or "portfolio" type of site, so that's what this is.

Sometimes I crave a more minimalist approach to web-design, as much as I love making creative and artsy websites, I enjoy very bare-bones blogs too. Finally, I think, this will scratch that itch. I also got to dive into a new framework, [Astro](https://astro.build/)! I really like it, especially for minimalist websites.

## Widgets
[Strawberrysnails](https://strawberrysnails.github.io/) is where all of my coding projects and widgets will live. But I will still link them here, as they are created FOR neocities/nekoweb/personal website users.

Speaking of widgets, I would really love if you would check out my [Steam Widgets](https://strawberrysnails.github.io/steam-widgets/demo/) and let me know what you think. Are they something worth using? Would you prefer a different set up? What other widgets would you use? Hopefully it's within my scope.

## Please comment
I would also love to hear what types of tutorials and code snippets people want to see! I'm now implementing a comment box for each blog post so please share your thoughts and opinions. If you're more comfortable in a private setting you can also [email me](mailto:hello@snails.town).

## Bye
