This blog post and many other regular site updates are much later than expected due to my recent focus on the new and improved layout. I hope you like it! I received many compliments on the old layout so I do apologize if you miss it. Thank you for sticking around through snails.town continuous improvement. (*/ω＼*)

## Games 

### **Playing:**  
- *Nier: Automata* – Still working on it.
- *Blue Prince* – Honestly not sure what the hype is about but maybe I will understand once I finish it.
- *League of Legends ARAM & Doom Bots* – No ranked or normals for me. I got my husband into the game just so we can play ARAM together hehe.

## Watching
### **Currently:**
- *Doctor Who* – My Husbands first time watching it. I enjoy re-visiting the old episodes a lot.
### **Completed:**
- *Katanagatari* – Very enjoyable but I don't know if I love or hate the ending.

## Site Updates
- [x] Major theme change inspired by Drakengard 3 and related content.

## Goals for Next Month
- Make some F2U Templates! 
- Update the media log A LOT. I want to add mini reviews and a filtering system for anime/manga. I also want to make the game log prettier with images and a filtering system as well.
