If you keep up with the blog, you know I wrote all about the process of [jail-breaking my kindle](/blog/jailbreaking-my-kindle.html) and even how to download/upload manga on it.After building up an extensive digital manga library, I quickly realized my current Kindle didn’t have nearly enough storage to handle it. With only a measly 8GB, I could upload about 10 volumes before running out of space. This wasn’t ideal, as I had to constantly re-upload and delete volumes as I got further into a series. I also enjoy switching up what I’m reading, starting new series, etc. Quite the problem (T_T)

## The Solution

At first, I thought, *How hard can it be to install a new hard drive into this thing?* Apparently, very hard— maybe even impossible. Then I considered buying an older e-reader with easier modding capabilities. That proved difficult too. An e-reader with a microSD card slot? *Maybe!* So, I set out on my research.

## The Problem with the Solution

It turns out a lot of the “available” e-readers with microSD slots are either extremely expensive, not available in my country, or discontinued. I really didn’t want to spend a lot and it felt wasteful to purchase a brand-new e-reader. Discontinued and pre-owned options were my only real chance.

Ideally for manga, I would want a screen size of at least 6.8". Any smaller and it becomes difficult to read. I also needed the ability to install [KOReader](https://github.com/koreader/koreader), the e-reader OS I know and love. 

Reddit eventually led me to a very helpful site: [Compare All e-readers on comparisontabl.es](https://comparisontabl.es/e-readers/). That’s where I learned about the discontinued Kobo Aura series, which originally retailed for about $150–$200, depending on the model. Kobo has since updated the Aura line; newer versions like the Aura 2 and H2O 2 no longer include a microSD slot, and those are what you’ll find on their website today.

## Storage Limitations

So, the Kobo officially supports microSD cards up to 32GB, which is fine, I guess. However, my manga folder is a whopping 90GB and growing. My husband came across a Reddit post where someone successfully used a 64GB microSD in their Kobo, so I had hope. My goal, though, was to get an epic 256GB microSD card working properly in this thing.

I ended up finding a Kobo Aura H2O (waterproof, by the way) on eBay for just under $100 and bought it. My hope was that somehow installing KOReader on it would allow it to read my hefty microSD. 

## Unboxing

Everything I hoped and dreamed came true. The KOReader installation was flawless and it was reading my 256GB microSD. I have my entire manga library port
