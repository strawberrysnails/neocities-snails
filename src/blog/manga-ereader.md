If you keep up with the blog, you know I wrote all about the process of [jail-breaking my kindle](/blog/jailbreaking-my-kindle.html) and even how to download/upload manga on it. After building up an extensive digital manga library, I quickly realized my current Kindle didn‚Äôt have nearly enough storage to handle it. Manga being all image files makes them *much larger* than e-books. With only a measly 8GB, I could upload about 10 volumes before running out of space. This wasn‚Äôt ideal, as I had to constantly re-upload and delete volumes as I got further into a series. I also enjoy switching up what I‚Äôm reading, starting new series, etc. Quite the problem (T_T)

## The Solution

At first, I thought, *How hard can it be to install a new hard drive into this thing?* Apparently, very hard‚Äî maybe even impossible. Then I considered buying an older e-reader with easier modding capabilities. That proved difficult too. An e-reader with a microSD card slot? *Maybe!* So, I set out on my research.

## The Problem with the Solution

It turns out a lot of the ‚Äúavailable‚Äù e-readers with microSD slots are either extremely expensive, not available in my country, or discontinued. I really didn‚Äôt want to spend a lot and it felt wasteful to purchase a brand-new e-reader. Discontinued and pre-owned options were my only real chance.

Ideally for manga, I would want a screen size of at least 6.8". Any smaller and it becomes difficult to read. I also needed the ability to install [KOReader](https://github.com/koreader/koreader), the e-reader OS I know and love. 

Reddit eventually led me to a very helpful site: [Compare All e-readers on comparisontabl.es](https://comparisontabl.es/e-readers/). I was able to sort by microSD reader, size, price, ect. I learned about the discontinued Kobo Aura series, which originally retailed for about $150‚Äì$200, depending on the model. Kobo has since updated the Aura line; newer versions like the Aura 2 and H2O 2 no longer include a microSD slot, and those are what you‚Äôll find on their website today.

## Storage Limitations

So, the Kobo officially supports microSD cards up to 32GB, which is fine, I guess. However, my manga folder is a whopping 90GB and growing. My husband came across a Reddit post where someone successfully used a 64GB microSD in their Kobo, so I had hope. My goal was to get an epic 256GB microSD card working properly in this thing.

I ended up finding a Kobo Aura H2O (waterproof, by the way) on eBay for just under $100 and bought it. My hope was that somehow installing KOReader on it would allow it to read my hefty microSD. 

## Unboxing

Everything I hoped and dreamed came true. The KOReader installation was flawless and it was reading my 256GB microSD, after putting it through a multi-step formatting process.  I have my entire manga library on the Kobo with plenty of room to spare. If you want an e-reader with a disgusting amount of storage, I highly reccomend looking for one that can read a microSD! It also makes uploading files a bit easier too.

The Kobo Aura H20 is bigger and clunkier than my Kindle Paperwhite but I don't mind "thicker" tech. I got a case for it (note: the only case I could find available) and I think it adds a lot to the bulk. It's still small enough to fit in my normal-sized purse. I fall asleep with it in front of my face almost every night now. Some small downsides include:

- No "warmth" screen settings but at a low brightness it's not bad at night.
- Remote control page turners don't seem to work. I tried 2 different kinds (that work on kindle) so the screens have some difference I don't understand.
- Only one case option (that I can find)

I hope to find a remote page turner that works or maybe DIY one? We'll see.  
I've been using [mangadex-downloader](https://github.com/mansuf/mangadex-downloader) and *other means* üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è of downloading manga as .cbz files.

Overall, I'm happy with my purchase and I will still get great use out of my Kindle. The kindle storage is more than enough for e-books, it's able to hold 5000+ books. I think bringing both e-readers when traveling will be easy.

I love having a small-yet-large portable libary of manga and e-books with me all the time. Thank you for reading, as always! (. ‚ùõ ·¥ó ‚ùõ.)
