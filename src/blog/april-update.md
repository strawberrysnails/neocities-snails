## Games
- **Completed:**  
  Nier Replicant – Onto *Drakengard 3*, its prequel. Happily working through the *Nier* series.

- **Playing:**  
  Modded *Stardew Valley* with my husband – Our goal is to reach perfection. (๑˃ᴗ˂)ﻭ
  *Infinity Nikki* – 1.5 is a little buggy but I'm excited for new content.

- **Watching:**
  Demon Souls – Husband let me create his character, like always. Her name is Arizonyaa. ₍^. .^₎⟆

## Reading
- **Started:**  
  *[Draco Malfoy and the Mortifying Ordeal of Being in Love](https://archiveofourown.org/works/34500952/chapters/85870804)* – Re-reading probably my favorite romcom ever. I kind of got out of the habit of reading so I’m sure something fluffy will help.

## Watching
- *MasterChef Australia* Season 7 – Cozy cooking. This version is slower-paced than the American one, which is too ADHD-ified imo.  
- *Succession* – Good show about rich people talking.

## Life Updates
- Married now. (!)
- Going to NYC this weekend.

## Site Updates
- [x] Created this patch note system.
- [x] Font switch to DejaVu Sans Mono.  

## Goals for Next Month
