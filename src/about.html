    <h1 id="about">About the site</h1>
    <p>This website is built with <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>, a static site generator, using <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a>. It is hosted on <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://neocities.org/site/snails">Neocities</a> and uses <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://deploy-to-neocities.neocities.org/">deploy-to-neocities</a> github action.</p>
<p><em>Snails.town</em> is <b>safe-for-work, mobile-friendly, and best viewed on firefox browsers with 1920 x 1080 display.</b> I try my best to keep the website as accessible as possible. If you have any comments, concerns, or complaints regarding this, please reach out to me via <a href="mailto:hello@snails.town">email</a>. I love feedback and I'm always willing to improve upon things!</p>
<p>The purpose of this website is a creative outlet for myself and to display my interests. With my lack of traditional social media, I've found a comfortable home on the indie web.</p>
<p>The design of this website is inspired by medieval aesthetics, gothic lolita fashion, and various video games. The plain doll from <i>Bloodborne</i> is my site mascot; She's one of my favorite character designs and a lot of my theme is based off of her color palette.</p>
<p>The code for this site is available for viewing on <a href="https://github.com/strawberrysnails/neocities-snails">Github</a>, from which you may take inspiration from.</p>
<h1 id="archives">Archives</h1>
<p>Archiving is an important part of the internet. As I continiously update this website, I will always do my best to preserve it's previous forms. Please note that most (if not, ALL) links are broken and these archived pages are <b>not</b> mobile-friendly.</p>
