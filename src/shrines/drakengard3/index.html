<h1>Drakengard 3 Shrine</h1>

<p>This page is dedicated to my favorite video game, <i>Drakengard 3</i>, also known in Japan as <i>Drag-On Dragoon 3</i>. It's an Action RPG written and directed by Yoko Taro and published by Square Enix. It acts as a prequel to <i>Drakengard 1</i> and is part of the <i>NieR</i> series, which many gamers are more familiar with.</p>

<p>I wanted to make this shrine to shed light on <i>Drakengard 3</i>'s amazing story. I feel like it's extremely underrated and overlooked within the <i>NieR</i> fanbase. I hope this shrine piques your interest and inspires you to maybe even play the game!</p>

<p>Please enjoy some of my favorite songs from the soundtrack as you browse the shrine.</p>
