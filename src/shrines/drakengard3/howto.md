# How to play Drakengard 3

Drakengard 3 was release exclusively for the Playstation 3, however it's very *very* simple to emulate. In fact, even if you have a Playstation 3, **it is highly recommend to emulate it anyways.** Emulating allows for you to play the game at 60fps, as it was originally capped at 30fps and has very slow loading times.

*Note: When I first played the game, my husband installed everything for me so I am just reverse engineering what he did. If you have any questions or need clarification, please feel free to contact me.*

### Step 1: Download RPS3
- Download: [rpcs3.net](https://rpcs3.net)

### Step 3: Download the DLC
- The DLC is technically *optional* but brings a lot to the story. You also get to play as the intoner sisters, which is really fun.
- When you complete missions from the DLC you unlock "Memories of the Intoners" which are extra stories that delve into the intoners lives.
- It also includes cute costumes and headgear for Zero and Mikhail.  ⸜(｡˃ ᵕ ˂ )⸝♡
