# How to play Drakengard 3

Drakengard 3 was released exclusively for the Playstation 3, however it's very *very* simple to emulate. In fact, even if you have a Playstation 3, **it is highly recommend to emulate it anyways.** Emulating allows for you to play the game at 60fps, as it was originally capped at 30fps and has slow loading times.

*Note: When I first played the game, my husband installed everything for me so I am just phoning him in to write this. If you have any questions or need clarification, please feel free to contact me.*

### Step 1: Download RPS3
- Download: [rpcs3.net](https://rpcs3.net)
- If you need further help with installing and setting up rpcs3, please refer to the [rpcs3 Quickstart Guide](https://rpcs3.net/quickstart).

### Step 2: Download and install Drakengard 3 
- For sheer ease of use, I recommend setting up [NoPayStation](https://nopaystation.com/) (NoPayStation is also very useful if you plan on emulating any other PS3 games). If you need more direct instructions with setting this up, please see this [Guide](https://www.cfwaifu.com/nopaystation/).
- Using **NoPayStation**, search "Drakengard" and download the US version of Drakengard 3 (only if you care about playing the DLC with Japanese voices).
- If you can't or don't want to use NoPayStation, here is another link to the main game.
- <a href="https://myrient.erista.me/files/No-Intro/Sony%20-%20PlayStation%203%20(PSN)%20(Content)/">Mirror</a> - and search "Drakengard". Use "Drakengard 3 (USA).zip".
- Once downloaded, you can install the .pkg file through the rpcs3 menu.

### Step 3: Download and install the 1.01 patch
- You'll need the patch for the DLC undub later, and it fixes some bugs you may or may not encounter in the game.

<br>
- Once downloaded, install it in the same way you installed the main game.

### Step 4: Download the DLC and Japanese Voice Pack
- The DLC is technically *optional* but brings a lot to the story. You also get to play as the intoner sisters, which is really fun.
- When you complete missions from the DLC you unlock "Memories of the Intoners" which are extra stories that delve into the intoners lives.
- It also includes cute costumes and headgear for Zero and Mikhail.  ⸜(｡˃ ᵕ ˂ )⸝♡
<br>
- In a greedy move by Square Enix, the Japanese dub was sold separately as DLC and doesn't add japanese voices to the Intoner's prologue DLCs (see step 4a). 
- I personally recommend playing the game with the Japanese dub, as intended.
<br>
- Using **NoPayStation**, download and install (the same way you've been doing it): "Drakengard 3 - Zero/One/Two/Three/Four/Five's Prologue" and "Drakengard 3 - Japanese Voice Pack" (as well as any of the cosmetic DLCs you want)

### Step 4a: The DLC Undub
- Despite the Japanese Voice Pack not working for the DLC prologues, someone has made a guide on how to manually patch in the japanese voice files while keeping your game in english.
- [Guide](https://gbatemp.net/threads/release-drakengard-3-dlc-undub-prototype-ver-0-70710678118.585938/)

**NOTE:** The process of undubbing the DLC will break the Japanese Voice Pack for the main game, thus I recommend not playing the DLC until **after** you complete the main game (Ending D) if you intend to play it in Japanese.

### Step 5: Play the game!
- Before launching the game, right click the game in your rpcs3 library and click "Manage Game Patches". At the bare minimum, I recommend ticking "Unlock FPS". However I also ticked "Disable low-res Depth-of-field" and "Increased Horizontal Camera Sensitivity".
<br>
- Launch the game!
