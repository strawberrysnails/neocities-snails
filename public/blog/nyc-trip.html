  <div class="blog-content">
    <p>My husband and I took a little day trip to NYC, here's what we did.</p>
<h2 id="museum-of-natural-history" tabindex="-1">Museum of Natural History</h2>
<p><img src="/images/blog/seal.png" alt="MoHH Seal" class="blog-img"> <img src="/images/blog/gemsbok.png" alt="MoNH Gemsbok" class="blog-img"></p>
<p>First stop: <strong>American Museum of Natural History</strong>. It was my first time here, I really enjoyed the fossils, mammal dioramas, and the ocean life exhibits.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/tiger.png" alt="MoNH Tiger" class="blog-img"> <img src="/images/blog/sealion.png" alt="MoNH Sea Lion" class="blog-img"></p>
<p>One of my favorite things I learned about was the Rafflesia, which I saw a sculpture of in the Hall of Biodiversity. It stood out to me because in <strong>Animal Crossing</strong>, if you get the "worst" rating for your towns environment, a large red flower spawns on the ground and it looked eerily similar to that one, so I had to find out its name. Rafflesia, aka "Stinking Corpse Lily".</p>
<p>I picked up something small at the gift shop too, of course.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/puzzle.png" alt="Wooden Puzzle" class="blog-img"></p>
<p>We spent hours at the museum but I would love to go back and explore more. Next time, I want to check out the mineral exhibits.</p>
<h2 id="obligatory-sweet-treat" tabindex="-1">Obligatory Sweet Treat</h2>
<p><img src="/images/blog/icecweam.png" alt="Ice Cream" class="blog-img"></p>
<p>After the museum, we had to get a sweet treat at <strong>Salt and Straw</strong>.</p>
<p>Strawberry Tres Leches and Salted, Malted, Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, respectively.</p>
<h2 id="central-park-walk" tabindex="-1">Central Park Walk</h2>
<p><img src="/images/blog/skyline.png" alt="NYC Skyline" class="blog-img"></p>
<p>After our sweet treat, we took a walk through <strong>Central Park</strong>. It was nice and quiet, a much needed break from the busy city streets. I saw so many turtles and a very nice view of the skyline.</p>
<h2 id="shopping-haul" tabindex="-1">Shopping Haul</h2>
<p>After the trek through central park from the upper west side, we got to do some shopping in mid-manhattan.<br>
Places we stopped at: <strong>UNIQLO, Book off, Kinokunyia.</strong></p>
<p>I don't have a <strong>UNIQLO</strong> local to me, unfortunately, so I wanted to take advantage of the NYC location. It was <em>huge</em>, so much larger than expected. My husband and I both picked up a few things. I stepped out of my comfort zone a bit and bought a dark green dress instead of black! Ôºà„Éªo„ÉªÔºõÔºâ</p>
<p><strong>Book off</strong> was definitely a favorite for me. We rifled through their used CDs and figures for a long time. I was on the hunt for <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://project-imas.wiki/THE_IDOLM@STER_MILLION_THE@TER_WAVE_02_Chrono-Lexica">this specific CD</a> (After realizing their stock of IDOLM@STER is excessive) but got a bit unlucky. I still found some cool CDs for $5 each.</p>
<p>At <strong>Kinokuniya</strong> I picked up a Hatsune Miku noodle stopper. She lives on my PC next to my others.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/cds.png" alt="CDs" class="blog-img"> <img src="/images/blog/mikufig.png" alt="Miku Figure" class="blog-img"></p>
<p>CDs: <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://project-imas.wiki/THE_IDOLM@STER_MILLION_THE@TER_WAVE_06_Hanasakuya">THE IDOLM@STER MILLION THE@TER WAVE 06 Hanasakuya</a>, <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://project-imas.wiki/THE_IDOLM@STER_MILLION_THE@TER_WAVE_15_chicAAmor">THE IDOLM@STER MILLION THE@TER WAVE 15 chicAAmor</a>, and <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://project-imas.wiki/THE_IDOLM@STER_MILLION_THE@TER_GENERATION_12_D/Zeal">THE IDOLM@STER MILLION THE@TER GENERATION 12 D/Zeal</a></p>
<p>Yeah, I like IDOLM@STER music a lot and it was like 90% of their CD selection.</p>
<h2 id="the-end" tabindex="-1">The End</h2>
<p>Well, I have a love/hate relationship with NYC but I wanted to make the most of it since it was my husbands first time there. I've visited many, <em>many</em> times. We both agree that it's a bit overstimulating and smelly. Dispite that, we had a great time! Now we don't have to visit for another few years hehe :3</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
