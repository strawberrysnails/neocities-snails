    <p>A "forever world" in Minecraft is a concept I first learned about via <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/S_5rg_OgYis?si=vfhf_njLEQTOsxpM">Luvstar on YouTube</a>. It is a world you create and intend to fully commit to and play on <strong>forever</strong>. I really loved the idea of having an archival world that you can go back to and look at after a few years. The idea is not to constantly play, just to play when you feel like it. The goal is to spend a substantial amount of time making something you love and want to look back on without the pressure of constantly building.</p>
<h2 id="why%3F" tabindex="-1">Why?</h2>
<p>I'm sure we're all in the same loop of starting a new world, building a base and maybe a farm, then deleting it or forgetting about it. That's why they call it the "2 week Minecraft phase". This idea will break that pattern (hopefully) and maybe Minecraft can become enjoyable and less repetitive. I also wanted to share this idea of a forever world with my fianc√©, whom I plan on being with forever. I love the idea of going back to the world together and seeing how far we've come. He was the one who suggested our playthrough of <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.gtnewhorizons.com/">GregTech: New Horizons</a> actually become our forever world.</p>
<p>I've never played GregTech and I have had bad experiences with heavily modded Minecraft, but he reassured me that its progression is very linear and the outcome is very rewarding. This will definitely break the loop of Minecraft being repetitive for me, especially since I'm going to have to learn a whole new crafting system.</p>
<h2 id="some-opinions-%26-concerns" tabindex="-1">Some opinions &amp; concerns</h2>
<p>Just a preface, I play Minecraft Java Edition. I like vanilla Minecraft, but the more I consider it, the more frustrated I am with Mojang. The updates and additions to the game are so blah. There are amazing modders out there that make beautiful things happen almost overnight compared to the official company who adds 1 new mob per year. It's always frustrating when you <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Minecraft_Live_2020#Mob_Vote">vote for a mob</a> you think is cool and it loses. <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/that-future-mod-glow-squid-axolotl-moobloom-etc">Why not add all 3?</a> I also have my own personal qualms with Microsoft.</p>
<p>Honestly I don't trust Mojang or Microsoft to keep the game running forever. Who knows, it could become subscription based (god forbid). You're already forced to have a Microsoft account to even play the game. My concern is keeping my forever world, along with its mods, safe from any corruption or loss. Right now, I suppose my options are to keep backups on both of our PCs. This world is coming with us through new hard drives and PCs, I'm sure. Our inevitable NAS build will keep it safe, right?</p>
<h2 id="actually-playing" tabindex="-1">Actually playing</h2>
<p>As far as I know, GTNH (GregTech: New Horizons) follows a questline to explore and collect resources to advance technology. <em>"Starting in the stone age you will barely be able to survive until you get your first steam machines and, eventually, reach electricity. Later on, you will have to visit other planets and dimensions to gather important resources and fight mighty bosses to channel their magical power."</em> (<a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/GT-New-Horizons-Modpack?tab=readme-ov-file#modlist---newhorizons">source</a>). I'm pretty sure you can go to space, but not for a long time.</p>
<p>As my fianc√© and I build and progress through the ages of technology, creating different bases and monuments throughout the world, etc., I want to find a simple way to mark our work with a date; whether that‚Äôs with a sign or something GT exclusive, I‚Äôm not sure yet.</p>
<p>GTNH is difficult and complex but I'm really excited to dive into GTNH and try something new with a game I've loved for so long. It will be a learning curve for me but I think that's what makes it fun.</p>
<h2 id="projects-and-goals" tabindex="-1">Projects and goals</h2>
<p>I've always wanted to take on a large, ambitious build in Minecraft (something Luvstar also mentioned in their video). GTNH really encourages that, it pushes you to create bigger, more complex structures as you progress through the tech tree. I‚Äôm still learning the mod, so I don‚Äôt have specific plans yet, but I do know it adds tons of new cosmetic building blocks. One of my goals is to build a massive castle base with a spiraling wizard's tower. It would be my biggest survival build yet.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope every Minecraft player will consider the idea of a forever world and perhaps try a modded version. Especially if you're unhappy with the current state of Minecraft, like myself. I hope to post more about my progress and experience too!</p>
