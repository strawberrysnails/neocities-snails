With only a measly 8GB, I could upload about 10 volumes before running out of space. This wasn’t ideal, as I had to constantly re-upload and delete volumes as I got further into a series. I also enjoy switching up what I’m reading, starting new series, etc. Quite the problem (T_T)</p><h2 id="the-solution" tabindex="-1">The Solution</h2><p>At first, I thought, <em>How hard can it be to install a new hard drive into this thing?</em> Apparently, very hard— maybe even impossible. Then I considered buying an older e-reader with easier modding capabilities. That proved difficult too. An e-reader with a microSD card slot? <em>Maybe!</em> So, I set out on my research.</p><h2 id="the-problem-with-the-solution" tabindex="-1">The Problem with the Solution</h2><p>It turns out a lot of the “available” e-readers with microSD slots are either extremely expensive, not available in my country, or discontinued. I really didn’t want to spend a lot and it felt wasteful to purchase a brand-new e-reader. Discontinued and pre-owned options were my only real chance.</p><p>Ideally for manga, I would want a screen size of at least 6.8". Any smaller and it becomes difficult to read. I also needed the ability to install <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/koreader/koreader">KOReader</a>, the e-reader OS I know and love.</p><p>Reddit eventually led me to a very helpful site: <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://comparisontabl.es/e-readers/">Compare All e-readers on comparisontabl.es</a>. That’s where I learned about the discontinued Kobo Aura series, which originally retailed for about $150–$200, depending on the model. Kobo has since updated the Aura line; newer versions like the Aura 2 and H2O 2 no longer include a microSD slot, and those are what you’ll find on their website today.</p><h2 id="storage-limitations" tabindex="-1">Storage Limitations</h2><p>So, the Kobo officially supports microSD cards up to 32GB, which is fine, I guess. However, my manga folder is a whopping 90GB and growing. My husband came across a Reddit post where someone successfully used a 64GB microSD in their Kobo, so I had hope. My goal, though, was to get an epic 256GB microSD card working properly in this thing.</p><p>I ended up finding a Kobo Aura H2O (waterproof, by the way) on eBay for just under $100 and bought it. My hope was that somehow installing KOReader on it would allow it to read my hefty microSD.</p><h2 id="unboxing" tabindex="-1">Unboxing</h2><p>Everything I hoped and dreamed came true. The KOReader installation was flawless and it was reading my 256GB microSD. I have my entire manga library port</p></div></article><a href="/blog">← back to blog</a><br><br><nav class="post-navigation"><div class="prev-post"></div><div class="next-post"></div></nav></div></main><!-- FOOTER ---><footer><a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://copyheart.org/">♡2025</a> | <a href="/map/">Sitemap</a> | <a href="https://github.com/strawberrysnails/neocities-snails" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Source Code</a> | <a href="https://neocities.org/site/snails" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Neocities Profile</a> | <a href="https://nekoweb.org/follow/snails" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Follow me on Nekoweb</a> (ﾐዋ ﻌ ዋﾐ)ﾉ</footer></div><!--
