It was a very special experience for me because when I first met my husband online, it was right after he had gone to Otakon in 2024. I had just went to my local anime convention recently too so it was something we bonded over. I always imagined us going together, wearing matching cosplay, and walking around the artist ally together.</p><p>It was a bit overwhelming and much larger than what I'm used to but I had lots of fun and both of my cosplays drew some attention, which was cool.</p><h2 id="cosplays" tabindex="-1">Cosplays</h2><p>On Friday I cosplayed Zero from Drakengard 3 and my husband was Emil from Nier: Replicant. I was so excited when people recognized me and took photos! One person even showed me their Zero keychain. Later that evening there was a Nier/Yoko Taro photoshoot. I was the only person cosplaying from Drakenhard so they made me post alone which was quite scary for me, however I did appreciate the love and excitement I got when representing Drakengard, since no one else was. Even though my outfit wasn't perfect, I made it completely from scratch and I'm really proud of that.</p><p>Saturday we cosplayed the hunter and plain doll from Bloodborne! We got lots of people asking for pictures too. Most of my costume was store bought except for the cloak and bonnet but the cloak itself was a lot of work.</p><h2 id="merch-%26-art" tabindex="-1">Merch &amp; Art</h2><h2 id="panels" tabindex="-1">Panels</h2><p>RPG Maker<br>Japan on budget<br>AMV Contest<br>Retro Game Challenges<br>Fashion Show</p><h2 id="closing-thoughts" tabindex="-1">Closing Thoughts</h2></div>---<br><br><!-- Google Form Like Button --><form class="mylikebutton">ü§ç</form></article><nav class="post-navigation"><div class="prev-post"></div><div class="next-post"></div></nav></div></main><!-- FOOTER ---><footer><a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://copyheart.org/">‚ô°2025</a> | <a href="/map/">Sitemap</a> | <a href="https://github.com/strawberrysnails/neocities-snails" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Source Code</a> | <a href="https://neocities.org/site/snails" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Neocities Profile</a> | <a href="https://nekoweb.org/follow/snails" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Follow me on Nekoweb</a> (Ôæê·ãã Ôªå ·ããÔæê)Ôæâ</footer></div><div class="theme-picker"><form aria-label="styleswitcher"><select name="styleswitcher" onchange="changeStyle(this.value)"><option disabled="disabled">Theme Picker</option><option value="miku">MIKU</option><option value="maintheme">OG SNAIL (default)</option></select></form></div></body></html>
